Balanced Biclique

Variables:
bool x[V], y[V];

Restrictions:
for all i in V: x[i] + y[i] <= 1
sum(x) = sum(y)
for all (i, j) in E: x[i] + x[j] <= 1
for all (i, j) in E: y[i] + y[j] <= 1
for all (i, j) not in E: x[i] + y[j] <= 1
for all (i, j) not in E: y[i] + x[j] <= 1

Objective Function:
max(sum(x) + sum(y))
